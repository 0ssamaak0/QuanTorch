**QuanTorch** is an educational library based on Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to build quantum systems, the library is designed to be simple, self-contained and easy to use.

Features:
- No dependencies other than Pytorch.
- can be used with GPU.
- modular consistent design, functions internally use other functions.
- well documented
